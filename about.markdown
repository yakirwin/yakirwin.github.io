I work as an algorithm engineer, like to watch sci-fi TV shows and do cool extreme challenges here and there.\
This blog is about things I like and things I want to write about.\
Programming, engineering, motorcycles, people, fitness, running, friends, family, games, love, computers, TV series,
money and freedom.
